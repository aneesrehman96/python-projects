# Optimizing Resource Allocations
This project contains a handful of different optimization problems and my solutions. At a high level, I looked to optimize financial resource allocations for products and services with various levels of associated costs and constraints.
# How I Did It:
Tech used: Python
Before beginning my analysis, I imported the following libraries:
* NumPy
* Pandas
# Techniques Used:
Considering I was focusing on optimization, I ran multiple nested for loops to account for the different resources I was looking to optimize, followed by if statements to factor in my constraints.
I made sure to visualize results graphically, where appropriate.
